# Hospital Database

This repository is my final project for the CS50 SQL course and serves as a design document for a SQL database that manages a medical facility's operations. The database is designed to keep track of patients' appointments with doctors, including patient information, doctor details, medical centers, departments, cabinets, appointments, reports, and bills.

## Course Overview

The CS50 SQL course introduced me to SQL (Structured Query Language) and the fundamentals of database management. It covered various aspects of database design, querying, and optimization. This final project represents the culmination of the skills and knowledge I gained throughout the course.

## Design Document

The design document for the Hospital Database project is available in the [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) file. This document outlines the scope, functional requirements, representation, relationships, optimizations, and limitations of the SQL database created for the medical facility.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following important files and SQL scripts:

- [schema.sql](schema.sql): This file defines the database schema and tables used in the hospital database. It includes the tables for patients, doctors, medical centers, departments, cabinets, appointments, reports, and bills, along with the necessary foreign keys and indexes.

- [queries.sql](queries.sql): This file contains a set of SQL queries that demonstrate the functionality and capabilities of the hospital database. It includes queries for finding appointments, reports, bills, doctor locations, patient-doctor relationships, and more. These queries help showcase the practical usage of the database.

- [medical.db](medical.db): This SQLite database file represents the hospital database, which is generated based on the schema defined in schema.sql. It contains actual data, allowing you to explore and work with the hospital's patient and appointment information.

These files are essential for understanding the structure and functionality of the hospital database, making it easier to work with and explore the data.
